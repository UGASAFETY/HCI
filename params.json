The University of Georgia offers some campus safety and\r\nsecurity services; such as security cameras, foot patrols, and key card\r\naccessible dormitories. However there are still incidents on campus and students’ safety can be\r\nincreased. \r\n  According to UGA, the institution currently addresses safety by offering security\r\nservices like 24-hour foot and vehicle patrols, lighted pathways/sidewalks, and controlled\r\ndormitory access (key, security card, etc). However, there are around 1000+ safety\r\nincidents per academic year on average. Our solution will work in tandem with current\r\nsolutions to increase student awareness, police presence, and a general atmosphere of\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n##Studios\r\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1xD737sdzoCQ2lWU3lVeWZBYW8/edit?usp=sharing\">Studio 1</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1xD737sdzoCc1QwUUg2TEJLeHM/edit?usp=sharing\">Studio 2</a>\r\n\r\n##Milestones\r\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1xD737sdzoCWkU5TlZXa0dZcms/edit?usp=sharing\">Milestone 1</a>\r\n\r\n***","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
